# Introduction
An application programming interface (API) is an intermediary through which two software components communicate to share data and get work done.

# Benefits of APIs
- Complexity abstraction
- Improved modularity
- Efficient development
- API expedites digitization
- Controlled accessibility

# Types of APIs
- Public APIs
- Private APIs
- Partner APIs: for users that have business relationships with the company that owns the APIs. These APIs have more robust security measures than public APIs. Generally, they are purpose-specific—such as giving access to a prepaid service—and are a widely used pattern in the ecosystem.
- Composite APIs: allow developers to bundle the request call for different services and get a unified response from different requested resources. Composite APIs are handy when a developer needs data from different servers without making a separate API call to each server. It makes the system work faster and more efficiently by reducing the number of API calls and complexity.

| **Type of API**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Public APIs        | B2C (business-to-consumer), e.g., Google Maps.                                                                                                                          |
| Private APIs       | B2B (business-to-business), B2C, B2E (business-to-employee).                                                                                                            |
| Partner APIs       | For users with business relationships with the API owner. More secure and purpose-specific, e.g., Amazon APIs for partners.                                             |
| Composite APIs     | Bundles requests for different services into a unified response, reducing API calls and complexity. Useful for data from multiple servers, e.g., Payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal). |


# Monolithic architecture
A monolithic architecture is one in which all the components of an application, such as, frontend, backend, databases, and any other component, are embedded in a single codebase. The application is developed, updated, and deployed as a monolith.

| **Advantages**                                                                                     | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy to develop and deploy as the application is developed as a single executable app with fewer components to manage during deployment | Hard to scale a monolithic application because all the components are coupled; to make changes, we need to update the whole system or application |
| Simple to test and maintain the application because all the components are coupled together        | Need to deploy the complete application after the update                                                              |
| Fewer security issues because the data is processed within a single unit, producing a response with low latency | Limitation of size and complexity                                                                                    |
| Low initial cost of the system                                                                     | CI/CD is difficult                                                                                                   |
| Resources for development are less costly                                                         | Problems with reliability—the whole application can be down because of an issue                                      |

# Microservice architecture
A microservice is an architecture in which an application is divided into smaller services. These services handle smaller functionalities and data of the application by communicating with each other using defined protocols. They can be physically separated but connected through protocols.

| **Advantages**                                                                                     | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy to manage larger applications due to decoupled services                                       | Costly in terms of services, development, and networking                                                              |
| Easy development and deployment strategy as each microservice is updated individually             | More complex to manage due to its distributed attributes                                                              |
| Reliable as a single service failure can’t bring down the whole application                       | Security issues as communication between services can make data vulnerable                                            |
| CI/CD is easier than monolithic                                                                    | Less secure than monolithic                                                                                           |

# API gateway

In a scenario where a client application must interact with multiple microservices at a time, a typical approach would be to make a separate API call for each microservice. This impacts resource consumption, performance, and task time. The API gateway comes in to help by acting as a single entry point for all the API requests. It sits between the microservices and clients, acting as a gateway.

The API gateway takes the client’s calls and routes them to the appropriate microservice by processing the parameters in composite API calls. It retrieves the responses from all microservices and sends a unified response to the client’s requests. Most applications depend on APIs; therefore, cyber attacks target them because they can expose valuable users and system data. It is of utmost importance to protect APIs from unauthorized access. An API gateway plays the following essential roles:
- security, authentication, and rate limiting to protect APIs from overuse
- analysis mechanism to monitor the behavior of the users with the help of monitoring tools
- helpful in microservice architecture to disseminate a single API call to multiple services and compile an answer in return
- provide stabilization to the system by balancing the network traffic


# Characteristics of a good API
| **Characteristics**                     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Separation between API specification and its implementation | Includes separation between the specification and its implementation, that is, the behavior with the internal structural details. Clean designs allow iterative improvements and changes to the API implementation. |
| Concurrency                              | Amount of API calls that can be active simultaneously in a specified period. Useful in ensuring that computing resources are available for all users.               |
| Dynamic rate-limiting                    | Strategy to limit access to API within a timeframe. Avoids overwhelming the API with an onslaught of requests.                                                     |
| Security                                 | Well-defined security mechanisms for authentication and authorization protocols that define who can access the API and what parts of the API they can access.       |
| Error warnings and handling              | Allows error handling effectively to prevent frustration on the consumer end. Reduces debugging efforts for developers.                                             |
| Architectural styles of an API           | Possible to follow different architectural styles according to its requirements.                                                                                    |
| Minimal but comprehensive and cohesive   | API should be as terse as possible but fulfill its goals.                                                                                                           |
| Stateless or state-bearing               | API functions can be stateless and/or maintain their state, but idempotency (operations that yield the same result when performed multiple times) is a desired feature. |
| User adoption                            | APIs that have good adoption often have a devoted user community that helps improve the API over many iterations.                                                  |
| Fault tolerance                          | Failures are inevitable, but a well-designed API can be made fault-tolerant by using mechanisms that ensure continued operation of the API, even if some components malfunction. |
| Performance measurement                  | There should be appropriate provisions for collecting monitoring data and early warning systems.                                                                    |
